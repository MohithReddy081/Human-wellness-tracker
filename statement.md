# Project Statement: Simple CLI Human Wellness Tracker

## Problem Statement
The project addresses the challenge faced by busy students who struggle to consistently monitor and correlate simple daily health metrics (sleep, hydration, and activity). This inconsistency prevents them from identifying effective patterns for improving focus, energy levels, and overall well-being.

## Scope of the Project
The project is scoped as a **Command-Line Interface (CLI) application** built in Python. It is designed for single-user operation.

* **In-Scope:** Logging, retrieval, and summarization of Sleep (hours), Water Intake (liters), and Exercise (minutes). Data persistence is handled via local file storage.
* **Out-of-Scope:** The project will not include a Graphical User Interface (GUI), complex database integration, or integration with external wearable devices or APIs.

## Target Users
The primary target users are ** Youth ** who need a minimal, distraction-free tool to manage their daily habits and are comfortable operating in a console environment.

## High-Level Features
1.  Record daily wellness logs.
2.  Retrieve and display the full history of recorded logs.
3.  Generate a weekly analytical summary.
